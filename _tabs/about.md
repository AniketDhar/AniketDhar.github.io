Hi! I‚Äôm Aniket Dhar, a software engineer with an interest in computer vision, robotics, machine learning, and full-stack development. I enjoy exploring how computers perceive the world ‚Äî which is why I like to say I'm ‚Äútrying to see the world through robotic eyes.‚Äù

I specialize in modern C++, Python, and Computer Vision, with practical experience using PyTorch, Keras, and ROS2. My work ranges from low-level perception and mapping algorithms to MLOps support and real-time system integration in automotive environments. I‚Äôve taken on responsibilities not only as an engineer but also as a Product Owner and Deputy Team Lead, managing small technical teams and collaborating across international, cross-functional groups.

## üß∞ Projects I‚Äôve Worked On:
- Instance Segmentation for HD Map Localization ‚Äî part of a decentralized system for urban driving environments.

- Monocular Depth-Based Road Geometry Estimation ‚Äî achieving <10 cm height error in mapping road profiles.

- Camera-Based Localization System ‚Äî ported from LiDAR to 360¬∞ multi-camera setups, optimized for real-time vehicle operation.

- 3D Visual Perception for Parking Assist ‚Äî fused monocular camera feeds into 3D occupancy maps using C++14.

You can explore more of these in the [Projects](/projects/) section.

## üéì Education
I hold a:

- MSc in Embedded Systems from TU Delft, The Netherlands (2018), with a focus on Computer Vision & Deep Learning.

- B.Tech in Electronics & Communication from NIT Agartala, India (2013), with a focus on Embedded Systems.

## üß† Skills & Tools
Some tools and frameworks I use regularly:

`C++`, `Python`, `ROS2`, `OpenCV`, `PyTorch`, `Docker`, `Jenkins`, `Git`, `ONNX`, `Weights & Biases`

I‚Äôm also familiar with DevOps workflows, validation pipelines, and embedded deployment environments.

## üåç Languages
I speak:

- English (fluent)
- German (conversational)
- Hindi (fluent)
- Bengali (mother tongue)

## üí° Why This Site?
This website is my personal space ‚Äî a way to document my professional journey, share personal projects, and experiment with web development using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. I'm not from a heavy frontend background, but I‚Äôm enjoying learning how themes, layout, and configuration come together to make something both functional and personal. 

You'll find my CV, Projects, and maybe a few blog posts or personal ideas here as I continue building.
